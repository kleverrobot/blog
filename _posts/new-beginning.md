Today marks the beginning of a new journey for me.

I spent the last 10 years working for an [amazing tech company called Galvanize](https://build.wegalvanize.com/). I got to work on products that transformed an industry and impacted the world in a positive way. I made lifelong friends, learned more than I can write in a single post and most importantly, **I loved my work**. It was the best job I ever had. One where I got to play a role in growing a small start up into a [Vancouver tech unicorn](https://biv.com/article/2021/03/sightings-billion-dollar-homegrown-unicorns-are-rare-bc). But that‚Äôs a story for another day.

Today I want to tell you why I left the best job I ever had.

There have been several points in my career where I was at a transition point. The work was still interesting, but no longer exciting. The last 10 years at Galvanize I was always able to find that next step or new challenge internally. But this time was different. I longed for something totally different. I wanted to test myself outside the comfortable guardrails of Galvanize. So I started to look around and ask myself:

- ‚ÄúWhere are my interests pulling me?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúWhat do I want to learn?‚Äù
- ‚ÄúHow do I need to grow?"

As I reflected back on my career, I realized that all my best growth as a person and a leader has come when I was in over my head. When I had no idea what I was doing. In these moments I was forced into rapid growth out of necessity. Our fearless leader and (former) CEO Laurie Schultz likes to say:

> ‚ÄúLeaders make promises they don‚Äôt know how to keep, then spend all of their time living up to their word.‚Äù

People who think this statement leads to false promises have missed the point. It‚Äôs not about creating unrealistic expectations. It‚Äôs about setting the bar high, being in over your head and using all of the resources at your disposal to find a path forward. 

There is no better way to put it, than using another quote from Laurie:

> ‚ÄúLeaders create a future that otherwise would not have existed.‚Äù

No matter the outcome, this is where real, rapid growth comes from. If you fail, you‚Äôve surely learned some new things along the way and have much deeper understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. If you succeed, then you probably accomplished something amazing! Isn't this exactly why we immerse ourselves in our work? These are the moments in time where you will look back and say to yourself, "that's when we took a massive step forward". 

I got to experience what this is like first hand multiple times at Galvanize. More often than not we succeeded. When we fell short, we owned it and learned from it. We took our learnings and went back to the whiteboard with a fresh perspective.

I wanted to take my 10 years of success and failures, my ability to navigate through ambiguity, my relentless desire to solve customer problems and point them in a new direction. I wanted to test myself. The hard part was finding the right direction for this next step.

Clarity emerged when I experienced an unsolved problem that was directly related to one of my interests. A Product Managers dream. I didn't know right away. It took 8 months of chipping away at the problem a little bit at a time, until I came to a point where I couldn't progress further without throwing my whole self at it. So I decided to leave the best job I ever had, to pursue this idea and start my own company. 

Today is my first official day on the job as founder and CEO of a Victoria based tech company. We have 2 employees (including me), no customers, no revenue and no product. What could possibly go wrong?

We are in WAY over our heads and I‚Äôm already learning and growing more than I had in the last 3 years combined. I‚Äôm loving every second of it. My true measure of success, will be when we create a future that otherwise would not have existed. Luckily for me, I have 10 years of great mentorship, guidance and leadership from Galvanize that will help me navigate this next adventure.

I can‚Äôt wait to share our product with the world. I plan to keep writing about our journey, our products and my learnings over the years of shipping software. Until then, see you later and thanks for reading üëã
