Today marks the beginning of a new journey for me. 

I spent the last 10 years working for an [amazing tech company called Galvanize](https://build.wegalvanize.com/). I got to work on products that transformed an industry and impacted the world in a positive way. I made lifelong friends, learned more than I can write in a single post and most importantly, *I loved my work*. It was the best job I ever had. One where I got to play a role in growing a small start up into a [Vancouver tech unicorn](https://biv.com/article/2021/03/sightings-billion-dollar-homegrown-unicorns-are-rare-bc). But that’s a story for another day.

Today I want to tell you why I left the best job I ever had. 

There have been several points in my career where I had plateaued or felt like I stagnated. The work was usually still interesting, but no longer exciting. The last 10 years at Galvanize I was always able to find that next step or new challenge internally. But this time was different. I wanted something totally new. I wanted to test myself outside the comfortable guardrails of Galvanize. So I started to look around and ask myself:

/“What am I going to do next?”/
/“Where are my interests pulling me?”/
/“What do I want to learn?”/ 
/“Ho do I need to grow?”/

As I reflected back on my career, I realized that all my best growth as a person and leader has come when I was in over my head. In these moments I was forced into rapid growth out of necessity. Our fearless leader and (former) CEO Laurie Schultz likes to say :

> “Leaders make promises they don’t know how to keep, then spend all of their time living up to their word.”

People who think this statement leads to false promises have missed the point. It’s not about creating unrealistic expectations. It’s about setting the bar high, being in over your head and using all of the resources at your disposal to find a path forward. This is what LEADERS DO! 

There is no better way to put it, than using another quote from Laurie:

> “Leaders create a future that otherwise would not have existed.”

No matter the outcome, this is where real, rapid growth comes from. If you fail, you’ve surely learned some new things along the way and have much deeper understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. If you succeed, then you have accomplished something great. 

I got to experience what is what like first hand many times at Galvanize. More often than not we succeed. When we fell short, we’d own it and learn from it. We’d take what we’d learned and go back to the drawing board with a fresh perspective. 

How was I going to top this?

Clarity emerged when I experienced an unsolved problem that was directly related to my interests. A Product Managers dream scenario. So I decided to leave the best job I ever had, to pursue this idea and start my own company.

Today is my first official day on the job as founder and CEO of a Victoria based tech company. We have 2 employees (including me), no customers, no revenue and no product. What could possibly go wrong?

We are in WAY over our heads and I’m already learning and growing more than I had in the last 3 years combined. In short, I’m loving every second of it. My experience at Galvanize has made me comfortable with the uncomfortable and confident in navigating ambiguity. My true measure of success, will be when we create a future that otherwise would not have existed.

I can’t wait to share our product with the world. I plan to keep writing about our journey, product and my learnings over the years of shipping software. Until then, see you later and thanks for reading 👋
