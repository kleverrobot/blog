Let’s get one thing out of way. I’m not a software engineer. No one would ever pay me money to write code. Yet, I invested time in learning how to code. I’ve always known a bit of HTML and CSS, but lately I’ve been dabbling in javascript, python, swift and others. I didn’t do this because I have aspirations of building my own product, although I have set that as a goal for the year. I did it for a very specific purpose.

Knowing how applications are written and work will make you a better product manager. Here are some reasons why:

### Better communication with your development team
If you know how to code you will build some street cred with your development team. Not only that, but you will also be able to speak their language. Imagine working on the UX design with someone who speaks a different language than you. That's going to be a challenge. Well that is exactly what happens when developers start talking about props, routers and typescript. Knowing how to speak the language and read a bit of code will help you better commnunicate with your teams and build better products. That is a fact. There have been countless times where I was able to steer us clear of what would have been a tech debt nightmare by spotting a flaw in the technical design because soemthing got mis-translated from the customer to the developer. It's like a game of telephone sometimes, and if you have enough technical chops to spot the translation error it will really accelerate your ability to ship great products.

### Improved prioritization
Everyone knows that estimates are hard. We also know that Product Managers like to think they know ‘what’s easy’ and ‘what's hard’. There is no phrase on the planet more cringe worthy to a development team than a Product Manager saying to a customer "Oh yeah, don't worry, that's easy". Guess what? If you know how your product works at the code level and can even write a few lines yourself, you are in a way better position to make that call. And it doesn't take a genius to know that being able to distinguish between 'easy' and 'hard' can save you a lot of back and forth with your team and help you streamline your roadmap. You will also save getting egg on your face when you have to go back to the customer and explain why it's 'not as easy as you thought'.

### Stronger design partnership with your team
That’s right I said **design partner**. Design is more than UX. Design is every part of a product. How it looks, feels, works and functions. This means that UX, Product and R&D are **all** part of the design process. And design isn’t “done” until you ship. (Even then it’s not really done…that’s just the first version you were willing to share with the world). If the development team undestands the customer and the domain, they will be great design partners for you. All the best developers I've worked with over the years understand the business side. So then why do Product Managers get to escape understanding the technology? Roll up your sleeves and take a few beginner classes in the evening. Now you can have a 2 way street of collaboration with the team.

### Better Customer Success
Have you ever been in a conversation with a customer and you didn't know the behaviour of a feature they were asking about. "Let me go test that for you and get back to you". This doesn't happen if you understand how your product is architected.
When you can use your knowledge of the domain and customer and see where there might be design flaws or misunderstandings from your development team, you will have entered next level product management.

When you understand the data model of your software product you will not just know what happens when you click on something, but you’ll know why it works that way. That deep understanding can help you improve the product as you’ll really understand what makes it great and where it needs improvement. Get the data model right and everything else becomes easy.
