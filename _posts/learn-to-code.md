Let’s get one thing out of way. I am not a software engineer. No one would ever pay me money to write code. Yet, I invested time in learning how to code. I’ve always known a bit of HTML and CSS, but lately I’ve been dabbling in javascript, python and others. I didn’t do this because I want to become a software engineer. I did it to level up my technical game. 

Knowing how applications are written and work will make you a better product manager. Here are some reasons why:

---

### Better communication with your development team
If you know how to code you will build some street cred with your development team. Not only that, but you will also be able to speak their language. Imagine working on a project with someone who speaks a different language than you. That's going to be a challenge. Well that is exactly what happens when developers start talking about the code and you have no idea what they're saying. Knowing how to speak their language and read a bit of code will help you better commnunicate with your teams and build better products. That is a fact. There have been countless times where I was able to steer us clear of what would have been a tech debt nightmare by spotting a flaw in the technical design because soemthing got mis-translated from the customer to the developer. It's like a game of telephone sometimes, and if you have enough technical chops to spot the translation error it will really accelerate your ability to ship great products.

### Improved prioritization and estimates
Everyone knows that estimates are hard. We also know that Product Managers like to think they know ‘what’s easy’ and ‘what's hard’. There is no phrase on the planet more cringe worthy to a development team than a Product Manager saying to a customer "Oh yeah, don't worry, that's easy". Guess what? If you know how your product works at the code level and can even write a few lines yourself, you are in a way better position to make that call. And it doesn't take a genius to know that being able to distinguish between 'easy' and 'hard' can save you a lot of back and forth with your team and help you streamline your roadmap. You will also save getting egg on your face when you have to go back to the customer and explain why it's 'not as easy as you thought'.

### Stronger design partnership with your team
That’s right I said **design partner**. Design is more than UX. Design is every part of a product. How it looks, feels, works and functions. This means that UX, Product and R&D are **all** part of the design process. And design isn’t “done” until you ship. (Even then it’s not really done…that’s just the first version you were willing to share with the world). If the development team undestands the customer and the domain, they will be great design partners for you. All the best developers I've worked with over the years understand the business side. So then why do Product Managers get to escape understanding the technology? Roll up your sleeves and take a few beginner classes. Now you can have a 2 way street of collaboration with the development team.

### Better customer success
Have you ever been in a conversation with a customer and you didn't know the behaviour of a feature they were asking about. "Let me go test that for you and get back to you". This doesn't happen if you understand how your product works behind the scenes (not just the UI).

When you understand the data model of your software product you will not just know what happens when you click on something, but you’ll also know **why** it works that way. This type of deep understanding can help you improve the product as you’ll really understand what makes it great and where it needs improvement. Get the data model right and everything else is easy.

### So how do you get started?
If you are totally new to programming, then I'd suggest starting with HTML. You don't need to become proficient. Just familiarize yourself with the syntax and learn some basic stuff. Trust me, it'll be worth it (even if it's a bit scary in the beginning). 

I learn the best when I can apply the skills I am learning. So I set a goal to build this website using next.js, tailwind and typescript (the tech for the front end of our app). Here are the resources I used to build this website.

### freecodecamp.org
I've been using [freecodecamp](freecodecamp.org) to learn Javascript, but they have lessons on just about anything you could imagine. I also like that they have little mini tests for each new concept they teach you

### tailwindcss
After refreshing my HTML and CSS at freecodecamp, I did the tailwindcss tutorial [here](tailwindcss.com). Honestly, you don't need this, but I found that it made CSS and styling **a lot** more accessible to someone like me.

### next.js
So HTML and CSS are great if you want to just build static websites, but they will only take you so far. I wanted to go a step farther, so I went back to freecodecamp and did the basic javascript course. That was all I needed to dive into the next.js tutorial and build my very own SPA with dynamic routing and a real-ish backend.
