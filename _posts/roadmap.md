Why is a called roadmap? Roadmaps give very finite possibilities, they limit creativity and innovation. That makes sense when I’m driving somewhere and I want to get there quickly. That doesn’t make sense when you are building software in a highly competitive market. 

### Be different
You don’t want to take the same route as everyone else. You want to blaze your own path, be different, find a better way, come at the problem with a fresh perspective.

### Destination is not exact
When you’re driving somewhere you know exactly where you are going to end up. At a friends house, a particular store, your workplace. When building software you have an idea of where you end up, but it won’t be that exact spot.
